# **App Name**: Pokewordle Daily

## Core Features:

- Daily Pokémon Guessing: Present a daily Pokémon challenge to users where they have to guess the Pokémon based on hints.
- Hint System: Provide hints related to the Pokémon such as type, generation, and stats after each guess to guide the user.
- Guess Validation: Verify user inputs against a predefined list of Pokémon to ensure the guesses are valid.
- Feedback Display: Display color-coded feedback (green, yellow, gray) after each guess to indicate how close the guess is to the correct Pokémon. The system will use this tool and its knowledge of pokemon stats to do the validation.
- Sharing Results: Enable users to share their results on social media with a summary of their guesses (color-coded squares).
- Instructional Modal: Provide a modal with clear instructions on how to play the game, including the meaning of each color in the feedback system.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant yellow (#FFC61A) to capture the playful essence of Pokémon.
- Background color: A light-yellow (#FAF5E6) to provide a soft and engaging backdrop.
- Accent color: A dynamic orange (#FF6F00) to draw attention to action items and interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for the headings to give a modern tech feel
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, to keep the readability and a neutral design
- Use flat, minimalistic icons representing different Pokémon types (fire, water, grass, etc.) to enhance the visual cues.
- Keep the layout clean and simple, with a clear focus on the guessing grid and feedback display to reduce cognitive load.
